Hi guys, Mosaabdeh here with another truth pill for you to swallow...

Im not a huge fan of motivation content, I think most of it is a waste of time to be honest, But everyone deserves a dose to move forward, hopefully it will help some of you .

You’re all here to learn and make money, no doubt about that.

I mean, that’s the one of the biggest reasons most peopl join this website (there are many others, but id argue thats the main one).

However, many of us on here, suffer from a deadly condition which limits your ability to turn knowledge into cold hard cash.

What is that condition you wonder? It’s called Lazy-tis and unfortunately it is very contagious. and no, Medicine can't help you with this one.

What is Lazytis?

This condition has been around for years, but only a few of those  have managed to cure themselves of that disease.

It is an illness which affects your mind, productivity, and health. Seriously.

Its the same illness that makes you say to yourself " i dont feel like learning right now, ill just watch my netflix show and tomorrow morning ill get back to it"

or " seo is dead, i wont start a site, instead, ill play call of duty (or whatever peopl are playing nowadays)"

People with this illness have no goals, ambitions and action taking behaviour.

They sit on their backsides and expect to see results with extraordinarily little work. and then what? when things take time they shout off the roof tops

They develop this problem because of comfort, and laziness. thats all that is.

Have you ever heard the phrase “Give a man consistent sex, a full belly, and cheap entertainment, and he’ll throw his ambitions right out the window”.
It is 100% true and can explain majority of problems in todays worlds. No one has that hunger anymore.

If you want to see results, and make changes to your life, then this is what you need to get started.

What is the cure to Lazytis?

The cure to this illness, you need to turn on the switch in your head and go into “BEAST Mode”.

Everyone has untapped access to this source of power, but it takes a little push to see it through.

Beast mode is the ideology of taking what is yours. If you want success, you don’t sit around waiting for results, you go out there and MAKE IT HAPPEN.
This applies to all areas of your life whether it is making money, relationships, fitness and more.
But Moss, How do I switch to BEAST mode?
EASY. After reading this, grab a pen and paper, and write down all of the things you WANT to have.
Read what i wrote again. WANT to have. not NEED to have.

To increase your productivity, here are a few more tips id like to share with you. some are known, but have helped me personally, a lot.



1.Weightlifting & exercise :


Weight lifting not only challenges you physically but mentally too. seriously. if youre not hitting the gym you are missing out.
“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” - Socrates.



2.STUDY & then TAKE ACTION, DONT JUST STUDY:
When you study new methods - make sure u implement.
DO NOT GO ON LEARNING FOR WEEKS WITHOUT IMPLEMENTING. LEARN FOR A BIT, IMPLEMENT. LEARN MORE, IMPLEMENT THE NEXT PART. AND SO ON.
you get it? learn, take action, learn more, more action.




Seriously, good things take time. breath. put in the work. no ones chasing you. just learn, take action and you'll get there, i promise you.

P.S: there is no finish line. there are no limits. its all in our heads.

Hope this article got you moving, even a little bit.

Love y'all <3
